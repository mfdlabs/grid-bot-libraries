# ClientSettings.Client

This is a HTTP client that is used by Grid Bot to interact with the [ClientSettings API](https://clientsettings.roblox.com/docs).

It has been changed slightly to be able to function with: [grid-service-websrv](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-service-websrv), but still provides mostly the same functionality as the original.
