# Grid

This provides libraries for interacting with Grid Servers on the SOAP level (via HTTP) and process level (via processes on Windows and containers on Linux)

## Notice

While these interact with the Grid Server, you must provide your own implementation that adheres to the contracts provided by these libraries.
We do not provide or distribute any Grid Server implementations.

The usage of http://roblox.com is only for the namespace of the SOAP services and is not intended to be used to interact with Roblox's private APIs.
This is archaic and does not express explicit affiliation with Roblox Corporation.
