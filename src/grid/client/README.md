# Grid.Client

This is a HTTP client that is used to interact with a Grid Server via [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP).

## Notice

While this client interacts with the Grid Server, you must provide your own implementation that adheres to the contracts provided by this client.
We do not provide or distribute any Grid Server implementations.

The usage of http://roblox.com is only for the namespace of the SOAP services and is not intended to be used to interact with Roblox's private APIs.
This is archaic and does not express explicit affiliation with Roblox Corporation.
