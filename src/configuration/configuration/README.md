# Configuration

This library (formally named ConfigurationV2) provides a way to fetch configuration for an application.

It provides 2 base-line methods: from the environment and from [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).
It also provides a base-class for configuration providers to extend if they want to provide their own configuration source.
